-- Format for overwriting define values, this is a custom format for the mod:




NDefines.NMilitary.SLACKEN_MANPOWER_INCREASE = 0.5 -- from 2, to shorten wars by reducing the reservoir of manpower of professionalism.

NDefines.NCountry.PS_RAISE_WAR_TAXES	= 0 -- From 2 (wiki is outaded), this means war taxes now don't cost mil points, might revert this to cost 1 mil point instead
